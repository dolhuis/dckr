# dckr

My little local dckr experiment.

Bought some hardware, installed CoreOS on it:

Firstly: [loaded Ubuntu on a USB stick][http://www.ubuntu.com/download/desktop/create-a-usb-stick-on-mac-osx]

Secondly: [created a cloud-config.yml][https://coreos.com/os/docs/latest/installing-to-disk.html#cloud-config]

Thirdly: Booted up the machine from USB stick

Fourthly: [Downloaded the cloud-config.yml][cloud-config.yml]

Fifthly: [Downloaded the CoreOs installscript][https://raw.githubusercontent.com/coreos/init/master/bin/coreos-install]

Lastly: [Ran the CoreOS install script][https://coreos.com/os/docs/latest/installing-to-disk.html]

Logged into it: could see the prompt. Nice.
